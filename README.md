## üõ† Materials and Methods

### Runge-Kutta Method
Used for solving ODEs that describe reaction kinetics. The method estimates the next value of a variable by computing slopes at several intermediate points, improving accuracy over simpler methods.

**Workflow:**
1. **Initialization:** Set initial values for all variables.
2. **Iteration:** At each step, compute intermediate slopes and update variables.
3. **Repetition:** Continue until the desired accuracy or endpoint is reached.

### Newton-Raphson Method
Applied for equilibrium calculations, using the Jacobian matrix to iteratively solve nonlinear equations.
